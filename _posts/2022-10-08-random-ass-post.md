I fucking *love* cats. They are just the best. I mean come on, look at this little fucker!

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I
look at cat pics and squeel with delight. 

With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon
his sword; I quietly take to the gram and look at kitties. There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the gift that is the cat with me.
